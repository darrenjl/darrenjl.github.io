Last week, I attended an Agile Community of Practice talk on Agile Inceptions by <a href='http://rogeralmeida.github.io' target='_blank'>Roger Almeida</a> . During the talk I asked Roger the following question, “How do you know when you need to run an inception?”

Afterwards, I reflected on this and realised that I should have asked a different question, “How long does an inception need to be?”

The planning process I described in [How to Plan Your First Feature]({{< ref "How-to-Plan-your-First-Feature.md" >}}) is what I would now call the minimal viable inception. This should be the least amount done for any feature. As the level of uncertainty or number of stakeholders increases you can append other inception exercises such as stakeholder mapping. If you want to learn more about agile inceptions, this is a good place to start: <a href='https://agilewarrior.wordpress.com/2010/11/06/the-agile-inception-deck/' target='_blank'>Agile Warrior - Agile Inceptions</a>
