Have you ever committed to learning a new skill, but couldn’t find the time? You are not alone. This is one of the biggest problems I see when coaching people. Learning is integral to progressing your career, or any other area of life for that matter. So it’s important you find the time — however, it’s not always easy to do.

The first thing to consider is your motivation. Is this really that important to you? (More on this in a future post.) If you decide it is, but you’re still ‘too busy’, I’m hoping the following strategies can really help.

1. No extra time required
You don’t necessarily need to find extra time in your day. Look at your existing activities such as running, commuting and cooking, and try to incorporate your learning into those. Listening to a podcast, reading a book or watching online training videos can frequently be done side-by-side with everyday activities.

2. Change your mindset
Often when we don’t get around to something, we tell ourselves “I’m just too busy”. This gives us a get-out clause that’s very tempting. If instead we change our language to say “This just isn’t a priority for me”, it becomes a lot harder to justify skipping it.

3. Remove obstacles
Decide exactly what you want to learn and remove all other distractions.
For example, a web developer trying to learn a new technology or language could re-implement an application they have built before. This would allow them to focus on the new skills and ignore things that they figured out the first time around, like the business domain and design.

4. Optimise your time
Are you a fan of a Netflix binge? Do you get lost in your social media feed for hours on end? Time is your most valuable asset and should be used on activities that bring pleasure, purpose, or both. There will be some activities you do throughout the day that provide no value. As soon as you identify these, you can replace them with more productive activities that help you make progress towards your goals. But remember, downtime is important, so if these activities genuinely bring happiness keep them up and enjoy! For example, cooking is a real pleasure for some people — they find joy in preparing and eating home-cooked nutritious food. For others, it’s merely a means to an end. If you’re in the second camp, perhaps you could find an alternative. I love good food but don’t enjoy cooking in a hurry on a weekday, so I have a list of food providers that are nutritious, convenient and economic. If funds allow, you can apply this outsourcing approach to many other day-to-day activities, such as cleaning and laundry.

5. Optimise your learning
Listen on double-time.
Most audio and video tools online offer the option to increase the speed. It does takes some time to get used to it, but once you do, it’s a major time saver. I’ve been listening to and watching everything at double-time for over 6 months now. Initially I missed important points and had to pause and rewind, but now I can keep up.

Hopefully, by utilising some or all of the above strategies you will be able to take back some time and kick-start your learning. If you have any questions or any other strategies please comment below so we can all learn from each other.
