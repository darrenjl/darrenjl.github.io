# MAKE PEOPLE AWESOME
> "Tend to the people, and they will tend to the business" - *John Maxwell*

## Grow yourself
### Understanding the role
My One Liner: to help the team deliver meaningful work effectively and be as happy as possibly while doing so.

> "When engineering management is done right, you're focusing on three big things, You're directly supporting the people on your team; you're managing execution and coordination across teams; and you're stepping back to observe and evolve the broader organization and its processes as it grows." -  *http://firstround.com/review/this-is-what-impactful-engineering-leadership-looks-like/*

##### Servant leadership
> "While traditional leadership generally involves the accumulation and exercise of power by one at the “top of the pyramid,” servant leadership is different. The servant-leader shares power, puts the needs of others first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible." - *https://www.greenleaf.org/what-is-servant-leadership/*

##### Inclusive leadership
Inclusive leadership helps get the most out of diverse teams

- Value both the differences (uniqueness) and the commonalities (belongingness) of others
- When people feel included they are more likely to innovate and be part of a team
- Anyone can be a leader
- EACH Inclusive Leadership framework
  - Empowerment - allows people to do things their way
  - Accountability - holds people responsible for their own actions, see it, own it, solve it, do it
  - Courage - helps people put group interests above personal ones
  - Humility - fosters connections by encouraging people to learn from one another & demonstrate vulnerability and trust

##### Creative leadership - design thinking
> “Creative leadership isn’t about leaders simply becoming more creative. It’s about individuals leading for creativity. That means you, as a leader, must unlock the creative potential of your organization, no matter the industry. It’s your job to set the conditions for your organization to generate, embrace, and execute on new ideas. It’s a competitive imperative that will keep you ahead in the marketplace.” - *https://designthinking.ideo.com/*
