# INTRO
Below is a collection of topics with associated guides and references that I found particularly useful when making my transition from a software engineer to a team lead. This was always intended to be a private document but when mentoring people in my team transitioning into leadership positions I shared this and received the feedback that it was useful. I'm sharing now in the hope that it can be useful to others as well.

This is a living document which I aim to  continuously update when I find new and interesting things so the content and structure will change over time.

I'm experimenting with structuring the topics around the four guiding principles of modern agile as they really resonate with me.

# MAKE PEOPLE AWESOME

> "In modern agile we ask how we can make people in our ecosystem awesome. This includes the people who use, make, buy, sell or fund our products or services. We learn their context and pain points, what holds them back and what they aspire to achieve. How can we make them awesome?"

## Grow yourself
### Understanding the role
My One Liner: to help the team deliver meaningful work effectively and be as happy as possibly while doing so.

> "When engineering management is done right, you're focusing on three big things, You're directly supporting the people on your team; you're managing execution and coordination across teams; and you're stepping back to observe and evolve the broader organization and its processes as it grows."

#### Servant leadership
> "While traditional leadership generally involves the accumulation and exercise of power by one at the “top of the pyramid,” servant leadership is different. The servant-leader shares power, puts the needs of others first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible."

#### Inclusive leadership
Inclusive leadership helps get the most out of diverse teams

- Value both the differences (uniqueness) and the commonalities (belongingness) of others
- When people feel included they are more likely to innovate and be part of a team
- Anyone can be a leader
- EACH Inclusive Leadership framework
  - Empowerment - allows people to do things their way
  - Accountability - holds people responsible for their own actions, see it, own it, solve it, do it
  - Courage - helps people put group interests above personal ones
  - Humility - fosters connections by encouraging people to learn from one another & demonstrate vulnerability and trust

#### Creative leadership - design thinking
> “Creative leadership isn’t about leaders simply becoming more creative. It’s about individuals leading for creativity. That means you, as a leader, must unlock the creative potential of your organization, no matter the industry. It’s your job to set the conditions for your organization to generate, embrace, and execute on new ideas. It’s a competitive imperative that will keep you ahead in the marketplace.”

#### Data-driven leadership
>"People in leadership positions often got there in the first place because they have great instincts," said Jake Stein, founder and COO of business intelligence firm RJ Metrics. "The problem is that once you're in a leadership role and you're encountering a greater number of less familiar situations, your instincts are less likely to serve you well. Your gut is going to tell you how to operate based on old situations, not based on where you are today.... To truly help their businesses benefit from Big Data, leaders themselves need to adopt a more rational, data-driven mindset themselves, instead of relying solely on largely irrational human instincts. Stein noted that one key characteristic of data-driven people is a desire for intellectual honesty. They are willing to ask questions, even about their own assumptions, because they genuinely care about finding the right answer. Data-driven people are also acutely aware of the way their brains tend to trip them up."

#### Appreciative inquiry
>What is appreciative inquiry?
Appreciative Inquiry (AI) is a positive and innovative model for analysis and decision-making that focuses on the positive core existing in an organization in change management. The important question that you have to ask is, “What is working in our organization?” rather than “What is wrong in our organization?”
It fosters the positivity and the ideas of strengthening and improving the existing skills, knowledge, process, and management styles that are working right. Furthermore, with identifying these strengths, individuals in an organization will innovate and create shared future image that they want to collectively bring it to life. It is a forward-thinking innovation that requires collaboration from every individuals involved in the organization.

>Generic Process of Appreciative Inquiry (a.k.a. 5-D’s)
Choose the positive as the focus of inquiry
Inquiry into exceptionally positive moments
Share the stories and identify life giving forces
Create shared images of a preferred future
Innovate and improvise ways to create future

#### Delegation
7 Levels of Delegation: https://management30.com/practice/delegation-board/

## Grow others

# MAKE SAFETY A PREREQUISITE
>"Safety is both a basic human need and a key to unlocking high performance. We actively make safety a prerequisite by establishing safety before engaging in any hazardous work. We protect people’s time, information, reputation, money, health and relationships. And we endeavor to make our collaborations, products and services resilient and safe."

*(Source - http://modernagile.org/)*

# EXPERIMENT & LEARN RAPIDLY
>"You can’t make people awesome or make safety a prerequisite if you aren’t learning. We learn rapidly by experimenting frequently. We make our experiments “safe to fail” so we are not afraid to conduct more experiments. When we get stuck or aren’t learning enough, we take it as a sign that we need to learn more by running more experiments."

*(Source - http://modernagile.org/)*

# DELIVER VALUE CONTINUOUSLY
>"Anything that isn’t delivered isn’t helping anyone become more awesome or safe. In modern agile we ask ourselves, “How could valuable work be delivered faster?” Delivering value continuously requires us to divide larger amounts of value into smaller pieces that may be delivered safely now rather than later."
