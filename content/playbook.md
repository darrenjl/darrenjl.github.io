# INTRO

Below is a collection of topics with associated guides and references that I found particularly useful when making my transition from a software engineer to a team lead. This was always intended to be a private document but when mentoring people in my team transitioning into leadership positions I shared this and received the feedback that it was useful. I'm sharing now in the hope that it can be useful to others as well.

This is a living document which I aim to  continuously update when I find new and interesting things so the content and structure will change over time.

I'm experimenting with structuring the topics around the four guiding principles of modern agile as they really resonate with me.

# MAKE PEOPLE AWESOME

> "In modern agile we ask how we can make people in our ecosystem awesome. This includes the people who use, make, buy, sell or fund our products or services. We learn their context and pain points, what holds them back and what they aspire to achieve. How can we make them awesome?"

*(Source - http://modernagile.org/)*

> "Tend to the people, and they will tend to the business" - *John Maxwell*

## Grow yourself

### Understanding the role

My One Liner: to help the team deliver meaningful work effectively and be as happy as possibly while doing so.

> "When engineering management is done right, you're focusing on three big things, You're directly supporting the people on your team; you're managing execution and coordination across teams; and you're stepping back to observe and evolve the broader organization and its processes as it grows."

#### Servant leadership

> "While traditional leadership generally involves the accumulation and exercise of power by one at the “top of the pyramid,” servant leadership is different. The servant-leader shares power, puts the needs of others first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible."

*(Source - https://www.greenleaf.org/what-is-servant-leadership/)*

#### Inclusive leadership

Inclusive leadership helps get the most out of diverse teams

- Value both the differences (uniqueness) and the commonalities (belongingness) of others
- When people feel included they are more likely to innovate and be part of a team
- Anyone can be a leader
- EACH Inclusive Leadership framework
  - Empowerment - allows people to do things their way
  - Accountability - holds people responsible for their own actions, see it, own it, solve it, do it
  - Courage - helps people put group interests above personal ones
  - Humility - fosters connections by encouraging people to learn from one another & demonstrate vulnerability and trust

#### Creative leadership - design thinking

> “Creative leadership isn’t about leaders simply becoming more creative. It’s about individuals leading for creativity. That means you, as a leader, must unlock the creative potential of your organization, no matter the industry. It’s your job to set the conditions for your organization to generate, embrace, and execute on new ideas. It’s a competitive imperative that will keep you ahead in the marketplace.”

#### Data-driven leadership

>"People in leadership positions often got there in the first place because they have great instincts," said Jake Stein, founder and COO of business intelligence firm RJ Metrics. "The problem is that once you're in a leadership role and you're encountering a greater number of less familiar situations, your instincts are less likely to serve you well. Your gut is going to tell you how to operate based on old situations, not based on where you are today.... To truly help their businesses benefit from Big Data, leaders themselves need to adopt a more rational, data-driven mindset themselves, instead of relying solely on largely irrational human instincts. Stein noted that one key characteristic of data-driven people is a desire for intellectual honesty. They are willing to ask questions, even about their own assumptions, because they genuinely care about finding the right answer. Data-driven people are also acutely aware of the way their brains tend to trip them up."

#### Appreciative inquiry

>What is appreciative inquiry?
Appreciative Inquiry (AI) is a positive and innovative model for analysis and decision-making that focuses on the positive core existing in an organization in change management. The important question that you have to ask is, “What is working in our organization?” rather than “What is wrong in our organization?”
It fosters the positivity and the ideas of strengthening and improving the existing skills, knowledge, process, and management styles that are working right. Furthermore, with identifying these strengths, individuals in an organization will innovate and create shared future image that they want to collectively bring it to life. It is a forward-thinking innovation that requires collaboration from every individuals involved in the organization.
>Generic Process of Appreciative Inquiry (a.k.a. 5-D’s)
Choose the positive as the focus of inquiry
Inquiry into exceptionally positive moments
Share the stories and identify life giving forces
Create shared images of a preferred future
Innovate and improvise ways to create future

## Grow team members

### Understand people

It is important to understand the differt personality types people on your team have so that you can tailor your approach to suit each individual.

#### OCEAN
This is a nice simple personality theory that you can apply to yourself or others.

> "OCEAN: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. You can go through each to see if you or someone else ranks high or low for each category. In doing so, you can make better connections and improve your people skills."

## Grow the team

### Hiring great people

> “It’s all about finding and hiring people smarter than you. Getting them to join your business. And giving them good work. Then getting out of their way. And trusting them. You have to get out of the way so YOU can focus on the bigger vision. That’s important. And here’s the main thing….you must make them see their work as a MISSION.” - *Richard Branson*

Notes:

- Behaviour we currently see as opposed to aspirational values - write it down - that’s the culture deck. It’s not that innovative - just true.
- People are smart adults, why do they need to get permission for leave, expenses etc. They should be/are responsible for that in the personal life, why not in their work life. Keep track of what’s being done not how much time people spend at work. Give people bach the power.
- You can’t tolerate misbehaviour, you don’t need rules to do that. Leadership/HR need to lead by example.
- It's not about the 8 different kinds of craft beer, what's fun at work is successfully completing hard projects with a team of great people.

##### Google

<img src="/images/playbook/work-rules.jpg" alt="Work Rules book cover" style="width: 300px" />
*(Source - https://www.workrules.net/)*

Work rules carefully outlines the nine personnel rules Google follows.

He reports that the company’s leaders attribute most of its success to these nine axioms:

1. **“Give your work meaning”** – Google’s culture pursues “mission, transparency and voice.” It believes employees who love their work lead happier, healthier lives. It gives people the freedom to be their best, knowing they will act like founders, not employees and, as a result, they’ll preserve and enhance Google’s culture. Bock shares its higher purpose by including stories about how staffers have helped people and how Google arranges them to meet consumers they benefit.

2. **“Trust your people”** – Google values information transparency. Bock says it trustingly gives new employees access to its “code base” and proprietary algorithms on their first day. Sharing information helps Google coordinate projects and reduce redundancy. The company encourages employees’ ideas, complaints and suggestions. Leaders deliberately give staff members more freedom and autonomy than they – the leaders – feel comfortable giving. Page and Brin believe that if managers aren’t nervous, they haven’t granted their employees sufficient autonomy.

3. **“Hire only people who are better than you”** – Bock asserts that Google’s most critical personnel function is hiring, and that’s where it spends the majority of its HR budget. This is his bailiwick, and you can appreciate his inside perspective in this discussion. Google hires one-quarter of 1% of its millions of applicants. In contrast, Harvard University takes in a little more than 6%. If you want to work at Google, then head for State U. since Google prefers to hire exceptional state college graduates above grads from good or even top Ivy League schools. Its priority is exceptional past performance and cultural fit. Bock knows the best candidates don’t apply; they’re already busy in jobs they like. Google finds and tracks top talent using common tools like LinkedIn. Don’t get spooked, but it follows people for months or even years, building relationships and deepening its potential talent pools. When hiring, Google tests candidates for intelligence, leadership and “conscientiousness.” The process, Bock says, is designed to eliminate bias; candidates interview with four different managers who ask the same or similar job-related, situational questions. Google doesn’t let managers pick new hires for their teams, fire people, or bestow raises and promotions. As Bock clarifies, these limits strip managers of coercive power.

4. **“Don’t confuse development with managing performance”** – Google’s managers work with their employees to create clear, measurable and aggressive goals. Bock looks inside performance reviews, where managers propose a rating based on each employee’s personal progress in meeting planned goals. A committee of managers looks at all the employees in the group and makes the final “calibration.” Employees nominate themselves for promotions, and a committee decides who moves up. Google offers training courses in specific skills and knowledge. However, as Bock makes clear, it doesn’t provide classes in a vacuum. Instead, it tracks the outcomes of its training efforts. Google employees with expertise instruct other staffers. Google maintains a stable of experts for one-on-one coaching in career planning, leadership and sales.

5. **“Focus on the two tails”** – Google focuses on its bottom 5% and top 5% of performers. Leaders work to move lower performers up to average performance. Bock says Google learns what drives superior performance by studying its best workers, and uses its findings to assist low performers and hire better people. Employees also rate managers, who – though it doesn’t sound like much fun – meet with their teams after seeing their evaluations to discuss how to improve.

6. **“Be frugal and generous”** – Bock catalogs Google’s benefits, including free food, free shuttles, time off to dabble, electric cars for employees to borrow and on-site subsidized day care. Low-cost benefits include Employee Resource Groups, tech talks, on-site haircuts, dry cleaning and massage chairs. Bock says the company’s calculus is that Google reaps returns – in staff goodwill, loyalty and retention – that neutralize the cost of benefits such as fully paid maternity leave and spousal death benefits. Perks encourage serendipitous encounters among people who wouldn’t otherwise connect. Bock reports that Google encourages employees to form groups around various topics, work-related or not, and to invite speakers – many famous – to lead discussions on subjects from yoga to Game of Thrones.

7. **“Pay unfairly”** – Before its IPO in 2004, Google paid most people below market rates. Bock explains that it distributed stock options – and still does – to all Google employees, offering a significant payout, even wealth. After its IPO, Google raised its base pay and set up cash and stock incentive programs, such as its “Founders Award,” to mimic a start-up’s atmosphere of potential gains. Google employees sometimes request cash and stock, but, Bock notes, these awards have only a small impact on motivation and happiness. Experience-related perks are the most popular benefits. Bock acknowledges that two people at the same level can have a tenfold pay difference. Google rewards performance and results; on average, top talents earn two or three times more than low performers.

8. **“Nudge”** – Google uses subtle cues, tips, checklists and suggestions (or as Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein called them, “nudges”) to encourage people to make healthier, more effective choices. For example, Bock says, rather than ban unhealthy food options in its cafés, Google moved such items to the periphery, putting healthy choices and small plates at eye level in convenient places. To increase the impact of its onboarding program, Google sends detailed emails to managers about new hires, called “Nooglers.” The emails include best-practice checklists about how to engage and support new people from day one. Nooglers get a similar checklist with actions to take to accelerate acclimation. But, Bock explains, before Google makes changes, it tests them in small groups.

9. **“Manage the Rising Expectations”** – Google’s leaders encourage staffers to pursue their own ideas. Consequently, Bock explains, it has closed some programs, some after years of effort and significant cost. Recently, it curtailed the number of projects staffers can work on simultaneously. Bock covers the concern that Google may create a sense of entitlement by offering generous life and work benefits. Spoiled Google employees might even revolt when management takes something away. For example, he relates, when it changed the menus in two cafés to observe “Meatless Mondays,” some employees threw food at the chefs and posted threatening chats. Rather than fire these employees, Google shares anonymous details of their tantrums with their co-workers. Bock is proud that Google consistently puts principles above profits. To protect its values of trust and transparency, it immediately fires anyone who leaks privileged information for any reason, even by accident. So, if you wonder if Bock’s book tells any tales out of school, that should answer your question.



# MAKE SAFETY A PREREQUISITE

>"Safety is both a basic human need and a key to unlocking high performance. We actively make safety a prerequisite by establishing safety before engaging in any hazardous work. We protect people’s time, information, reputation, money, health and relationships. And we endeavor to make our collaborations, products and services resilient and safe."

*(Source - http://modernagile.org/)*

# EXPERIMENT & LEARN RAPIDLY

>"You can’t make people awesome or make safety a prerequisite if you aren’t learning. We learn rapidly by experimenting frequently. We make our experiments “safe to fail” so we are not afraid to conduct more experiments. When we get stuck or aren’t learning enough, we take it as a sign that we need to learn more by running more experiments."

*(Source - http://modernagile.org/)*

# DELIVER VALUE CONTINUOUSLY

>"Anything that isn’t delivered isn’t helping anyone become more awesome or safe. In modern agile we ask ourselves, “How could valuable work be delivered faster?” Delivering value continuously requires us to divide larger amounts of value into smaller pieces that may be delivered safely now rather than later."

*(Source - http://modernagile.org/)*
